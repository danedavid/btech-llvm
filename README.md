# btech-llvm
Simple and Modular LLVM based Live Variable Analysis project done as part of B.Tech   
  
## BBCount
To count no. of basic blocks in the source program and no. of instructions in each  

## FuncInfo
To print details like no. of arguments, no. of call sites, etc. for every function  

## LineNumber
To print the source line number that generated the corresponding LLVM IR instruction  

## Algebraic
To perform algebraic optimizations:  
X + 0 = X  
X - 0 = X  
0 + X = X  
X - X = X  

## LivenessHistogram
To perform Live Variable Analysis and print a histogram
